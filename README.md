# SimpsonsClassifier
In this project, pretrained neural networks will be used to classify the Simpsons by pictures.


On January 14: In current files we use pretrained neural network ResNet50 that gives accuracy 0.85.
                For fitting we use stepLr scheduler, and optimizer AdamW. With unfreezy all layers.
